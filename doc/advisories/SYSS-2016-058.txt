Affected Version(s): JD-0400EU-2/01
Tested Version(s): JD-0400EU-2/01
Vulnerability Type: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345)
                    Mouse Spoofing Attack
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: Open

CVE Reference: Not yet assigned
Authors of Advisory: Matthias Deeg and Gerhard Klostermeier (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

CHERRY B.UNLIMITED AES is a wireless desktop set consisting of a
mouse and a keyboard.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"CHERRY B. UNLIMITED AES combines secure data transmission and an
advanced energy supply in a design which has been thought through to the
very last detail. For high professional requirements and security both
at home and in the workplace."

Some of the key benefits of CHERRY B.UNLIMITED AES are (see [2]):

* Data transmission using 128-bit encryption, complying to Advanced 
  Encryption Standard (AES)
* USB cable charging function for both keyboard & mouse - even when in
  use
* High-quality, pre-charged NiMH batteries from GP with a very low
  self-discharge
* Almost interference-free wireless 2.4 GHz technology (range of up to
  10 metres)
* 3-button mouse: infrared sensor and adjustable resolution
  (1,000/2,000 dpi) with ergonomic side panels
* Multi-station capability operation of several wireless products in
  one room
* Easy to install, requiring no technical knowledge
* Mini USB receiver
* Keyboard awarded the "Blauer Engel" environmental seal

Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated mouse data communication, the
wireless desktop set CHERRY B.UNLIMITED AES is prone to mouse spoofing
attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The SySS GmbH found out that the mouse of the wireless desktop set
CHERRY B.UNLIMITED AES is prone to spoofing attacks, as the mouse
data communication is unencrypted and unauthenticated.

An attacker can analyze the unencrypted mouse data packets of the 2.4
GHz radio communication sent by the mouse to the receiver (USB dongle)
in order to learn the used protocol. By knowing the used mouse data
protocol, it is possible to spoof mouse actions like mouse movements or
mouse clicks by sending forged data packets.

Thus, an attacker is able to remotely control the mouse pointer of a
target system that is operated with the wireless desktop set CHERRY
B.UNLIMITED AES. If the graphical user interface of the victim's system
is unlocked, an attacker can for example send a list of mouse actions
that start the virtual on-screen keyboard of the operating system and
execute arbitrary commands in the context of the currently logged in
user, for instance a download and execute attack vector.

As the attacker may not have an unobstructed view to the target system's
screen and may not know the used operating system, the screen resolution,
or the current mouse settings, this kind mouse spoofing attack is based
on heuristics. But concerning an unlocked and unattended system, an
attacker can simply try different attack vectors for different target
system configurations sequentially.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The SySS GmbH could successfully perform mouse spoofing attacks against
a target system operated with the wireless desktop set CHERRY
B.UNLIMITED AES using an in-house developed software tool in combination
with the USB radio dongle Crazyradio PA (see [3]).

A proof-of-concept mouse spoofing attack resulting in remote code
execution using the SySS software tool Radioactive Mouse is demonstrated
in a video (see [4]).
