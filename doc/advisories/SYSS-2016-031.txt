-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA512Advisory ID: SYSS-2016-031Product: CHERRY B.UNLIMITED AESManufacturer: Cherry GmbHAffected Version(s): JD-0400EU-2/01Tested Version(s): JD-0400EU-2/01Vulnerability Type: Cryptographic Issues (CWE-310)                    Missing Protection against Replay AttacksRisk Level: MediumSolution Status: OpenManufacturer Notification: 2016-04-11Solution Date: -Public Disclosure: 2016-06-29CVE Reference: Not yet assignedAuthors of Advisory: Matthias Deeg and Gerhard Klostermeier (SySS GmbH)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Overview:CHERRY B.UNLIMITED AES is a wireless desktop set consisting of amouse and a keyboard.The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):"CHERRY B. UNLIMITED AES combines secure data transmission and anadvanced energy supply in a design which has been thought through to thevery last detail. For high professional requirements and security bothat home and in the workplace."Some of the key benefits of CHERRY B.UNLIMITED AES are (see [2]):* Data transmission using 128-bit encryption, complying to Advanced   Encryption Standard (AES)* USB cable charging function for both keyboard & mouse - even when in  use* High-quality, pre-charged NiMH batteries from GP with a very low  self-discharge* Almost interference-free wireless 2.4 GHz technology (range of up to  10 metres)* 3-button mouse: infrared sensor and adjustable resolution  (1,000/2,000 dpi) with ergonomic side panels* Multi-station capability operation of several wireless products in  one room* Easy to install, requiring no technical knowledge* Mini USB receiver* Keyboard awarded the "Blauer Engel" environmental sealDue to an insecure implementation of the encrypted data communication,the wireless keyboard CHERRY B.UNLIMITED AES is prone to replay attacks.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Vulnerability Details:The SySS GmbH found out that the wireless keyboard CHERRY B.UNLIMITEDAES is prone to replay attacks.An attacker can sniff the AES-encrypted data packets of the 2.4 GHzradio communication sent by the keyboard to the receiver (USB dongle)and replay the recorded communication data at will causing the sameeffect as the original data communication.A replay attack against the keyboard can, for example, be used to gainunauthorized access to a computer system that is operated with avulnerable CHERRY B.UNLIMITED AES keyboard. In this attack scenario, anattacker records the radio communication during a password-based userauthentication of his or her victim, for instance during a login to theoperating system or during unlocking a screen lock. At an opportunemoment when the victim's computer system is unattended, the attackerapproaches the victim's computer and replays the previously recordedAES-encrypted data communication for the password-based userauthentication and by this gets unauthorized access to the victim'ssystem.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Proof of Concept (PoC):The SySS GmbH could successfully perform a replay attack as describedin the previous section using a software-defined radio.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Solution:According to information from the manufacturer Cherry GmbH, the reportedsecurity issue will currently not be fixed in affected products.The written statement in German from Cherry GmbH regarding this and otherreported security issues is as follows:"Nach Prüfung der von Ihnen festgestellten 'Sicherheitsschwachstellen'haben wir uns dazu entschlossen, die AES Verschlüsselung bis auf weitersnicht weiter mit den Produkt zu promoten. Derzeit arbeiten wir an einemNachfolgeprodukt. Wie bisher, empfehlen wir Kunden mit hohenSicherheitsanfordungen ein kabelgebundenes Produkt zu verwenden.Je nach Anforderung, auch mit CC-Zertifizierung."The English translation of this statement is:"We have examined the 'security flaws' you reported to us. As a result,we decided, until further notice, to no longer refer to AES encryptionin order to promote the affected product. At the moment, we arecurrently working on a successor product. As we already did in the past,we recommend to our customers having particularly high security demandsusing wired products which, depending on the requirements, should be CC certified."~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Disclosure Timeline:2016-04-11: Vulnerability reported to manufacturer2016-04-12: Manufacturer acknowledges e-mail with SySS security advisory2016-05-24: Response from manufacturer with information about            the reported security issue and rescheduling of the            publication date in agreement with the manufacturer2016-07-04: Received written statement from manufacturer concerning the            reported security issue2016-07-29: Public release of the security advisory~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~References:[1] Data sheet for CHERRY B.UNLIMITED AES    http://cherry.de/PDF/EN_CHERRY_B_UNLIMITED_AES.pdf[2] Product website for CHERRY B.UNLIMITED AES    http://cherry.de/cid/wireless_keyboards_CHERRY_B_UNLIMITED_AES.htm?rdeLocaleAttr=en&WT.mc_id=[3] SySS Security Advisory SYSS-2016-031    https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2016-031.txt[4] SySS Responsible Disclosure Policy    https://www.syss.de/en/responsible-disclosure-policy/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Credits:This security vulnerability was found by Matthias Deeg and GerhardKlostermeier of the SySS GmbH.E-Mail: matthias.deeg (at) syss.dePublic Key: https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Materialien/PGPKeys/Matthias_Deeg.ascKey fingerprint = D1F0 A035 F06C E675 CDB9 0514 D9A4 BF6A 34AD 4DABE-Mail: gerhard.klostermeier (at) syss.dePublic Key: https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/PGPKeys/Gerhard_Klostermeier.ascKey fingerprint = 8A9E 75CC D510 4FF6 8DB5 CC30 3802 3AAB 573E B2E7~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Disclaimer:The information provided in this security advisory is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind.
