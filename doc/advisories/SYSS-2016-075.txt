                    Mouse Spoofing Attack
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: Open

Authors of Advisory: Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Targus Multimedia Presentation Remote is a wireless presenter using 2.4 
GHz radio communication.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"Don't fumble around with wires or fuss over the computer; present like
a professional and control your computer remotely, using just one 
device - the Targus Multi Media Presentation Remote with Cursor Control.
Thanks to the remote's 2.4GHz cordless technology, you can access
programmes, launch the internet, adjust volumes and play music and 
videos, all from up to 15 metres away."

Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated mouse data communication, the
wireless presenter Targus Multimedia Presentation Remote is vulnerable
to mouse spoofing attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The SySS GmbH found out that the wireless presenter Targus Multimedia
Presentation Remote is prone to mouse spoofing attacks, as the
cursor control data communication is unencrypted and unauthenticated.

An attacker can analyze the unencrypted cursor control data packets of
the 2.4 GHz radio communication sent by the wireless presenter to the
receiver (USB dongle) in order to learn the used protocol. By knowing
the used mouse data protocol, it is possible to spoof mouse actions
like mouse movements or mouse clicks by sending forged data packets.

Thus, an attacker is able to remotely control the mouse pointer of a
target system that is operated with the wireless presenter Targus
Multimedia Presentation Remote. If the graphical user interface of the
victim's system is unlocked, an attacker can for example send a list of
mouse actions that start the virtual on-screen keyboard of the operating
system and execute arbitrary commands in the context of the currently
logged in user, for instance a download and execute attack vector.

As the attacker may not have an unobstructed view to the target system's
screen and may not know the used operating system, the screen 
resolution, or the current mouse settings, this kind mouse spoofing 
attack is based on heuristics. But concerning an unlocked and unattended
system, an attacker can simply try different attack vectors for
different target system configurations sequentially.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The SySS GmbH could successfully perform mouse spoofing attacks against
a target system operated with the wireless presenter Targus Multimedia
Presentation Remote using an in-house developed software tool in
combination with the USB radio dongle Crazyradio PA and the
nrf-research-firmware by Bastille Networks Internet Security (see [2]
and [3]).

A proof-of-concept mouse spoofing attack that also applies to the 
wireless presenter Targus Multimedia Presentation Remote resulting in
remote code execution using the SySS software tool Radioactive Mouse is
demonstrated in a video (see [4]).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

The SySS GmbH is not aware of a solution for this reported security
vulnerability.
