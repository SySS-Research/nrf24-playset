~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Microsoft Wireless Desktop 2000 is a wireless desktop set consisting of
a mouse and a keyboard.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"This keyboard features Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) technology, 
which is designed to help protect your information by encrypting your
keystrokes. Each keyboard is permanently paired with its receiver at 
the factory - no key information is ever shared over the air."

Due to an insecure implementation of the encrypted data communication,
the wireless keyboard Microsoft Wireless Desktop 2000 is prone to replay
attacks with certain restrictions.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The SySS GmbH found out that the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 2000
keyboard is prone to replay attacks with some limitations.

An attacker can sniff the AES-encrypted data packets of the 2.4 GHz
radio communication sent by the keyboard to the receiver (USB dongle)
and replay the recorded communication data causing the same effect as
the original data communication.

According to test results of the SySS GmbH, the Microsoft Wireless
Desktop 2000 keyboard and its USB dongle have implemented a replay
protection based on an incrementing packet counter. But the used
window for valid packet counter values is large enough to perform
a replay attack if there were not too many data packets caused by
further keystrokes between the attacker's recording and the playback.

A replay attack against the keyboard can, for example, be used to gain
unauthorized access to a computer system that is operated with a
vulnerable Microsoft Wireless Desktop 2000 keyboard. In this attack
scenario, an attacker records the radio communication during a
password-based user authentication of his or her victim, for instance
during a login to the operating system or during unlocking a screen
lock. At an opportune moment when the victim's computer system is
unattended, the attacker approaches the victim's computer and replays
the previously recorded AES-encrypted data communication for the
password-based user authentication and by this gets unauthorized access 
to the victim's system.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The SySS GmbH could successfully perform a replay attack as described
in the previous section using the USB radio dongle Crazyradio PA (see
[2]) and a simple proof-of-concept software tool.

The following output exemplarily illustrates a replay attack with the
recorded data packets for the word "test".
